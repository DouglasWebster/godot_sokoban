# godot_sokoban
The classic sokoban game realised using Godot 4

The current aim is to have a version of sokoban where movement can be accomplished one of two ways:
1.  Using the classic up, down, left and right keys either from the keyboard or gamepad type device
2.  By clicking on a cell with the mouse.  If there is a valid path from sokoman's current location to the new location the move will be made using the shortest path.
